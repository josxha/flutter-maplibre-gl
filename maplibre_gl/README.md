`maplibre_gl` provides bindings for native MapLibre libraries to use in a 
Flutter application. It allows you to show performant interactive and 
customizable vector maps as a Flutter widget.

This project is a fork of 
[flutter-mapbox-gl](https://github.com/tobrun/flutter-mapbox-gl), replacing its 
usage of Mapbox GL libraries with the open source 
[MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre) libraries.

### Supported Platforms

- Support for **web** through [maplibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js)
- Support for **android** and **iOS** through [maplibre-native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native)

This project currently supports only a subset of the API exposed by these 
libraries.
