This Flutter plugin allows to show **embedded interactive and customizable
vector maps** as a Flutter widget.

- This project is a fork
  of [flutter-mapbox-gl](https://github.com/tobrun/flutter-mapbox-gl),
  replacing its usage of Mapbox GL libraries with the open
  source [MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre) libraries.

### Supported Platforms

- Support for **web** through [maplibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js)
- Support for **android** and **iOS** through [maplibre-native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native)

This project only supports a subset of the API exposed by these libraries.
